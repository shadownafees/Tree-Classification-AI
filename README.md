Development of a Neural Network for Tree Species Classification in University Garden The goal of this assignment is to develop a simple neural network architecture capable of classifying up to three tree species found in the university garden that are challenging to distinguish through visual observation. so we conduct a Field Survey and Data Collection for our project dataset we select three trees Tamarind, Indian Gooseberry and Caesalpinia Sappan
